## k8s Security

Docker, containers, and Kubernetes have transformed the way we create, deploy, and orchestrate applications 
on-premise and in the cloud. Yet as these solutions are prone to a number of vulnerabilities and 
secure misconfigurations that lead to significant breaches and security risks, 
it has become increasingly important that you know how to implement safeguards.

This fast-paced training will teach you the basics of Docker and Kubernetes security. 
You will learn the various concepts of container security, 
how to prevent issues related to container supply chain security, and
best practices around application isolation and protection. 
You will also learn about different authentication schemes, 
key concepts for how to perform logging, and how to audit the Docker platform. 

This training also covers clear advice on securing Kubernetes deployment, 
including how to secure the k8s API server, controller manager, scheduler, kubelet, worker nodes, and 
running etcd safely. 
You will also learn details about role-based authentication (RBAC), securing service accounts, 
Kubernetes Pod security policies, network policies, and secret management.


### What youâ€™ll learn and how you can apply it

- Docker security fundamentals
- Kubernetes security best practices
- Application isolation
- Multi-tenancy isolation
- Authentication schemes

### This session  is for you because

- You are a developer, operator, system administrator, network administrator, or IT security professional 
  with a basic understanding of Docker technologies desiring a deep understanding of securing Docker environments 
  at scale in an enterprise environment. security.
- You would like to better understand Kubernetes security best practices.
- You are an ethical hacker, security analyst, or engineer and want to expand your knowledge in modern application 
  security concepts.
